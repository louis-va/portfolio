## About

My goal for this project was to create a performant and accessible website with some creative custom 2D and 3D animations. It looks simple but has some interesting features - powered by the amazing Astro framework :
- Project pages are generated from markdown files at build time. This makes projects easy to add and the site performant.
- Transitions between pages are smooth thanks to Astro's View Transition feature. This allowed me to animate the logo when changing pages.

## Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
